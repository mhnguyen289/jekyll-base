I made my site by first creating a github public repository from "staticgen.com", then deployed the site so I could begin editing it in my text editor. Afterwards, I installed Netlify's CLI globally, deployed my site and authorized my github repository. Once deployed, I went to Jekyll's documentation and read how to install their gem as well as how to add post's through their sample application.
