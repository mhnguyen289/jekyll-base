The [React docs] are my favorite documentation because it not only makes it easy for developers to want to want to use their code, it clearly shows the step-by-step process with minimal clear directions, screen shots
and they also promote feedback through open source. I've contributed once before and it felt great to know that I was able to contribute to something new at the time. It was also important for me that the FAQ section was also very clear and concise as well since that's normally where I gravitate to the most.
