Prior to programming, I coached tennis for eight years and have always enjoyed teaching. After gradutating my coding program, it gave me the opportunity to teach coding fundamentals to code newbies, which allowed me to practice communcating clearly and also reminded me how great it felt seeing the students understand a concept they've been stuck on for days. This not only helped me understand the topics I taught but also reminded me the simple joys of teaching.

Technical support for me is relatable because it essentially allows me to be an expert in a product, their developers, and their needs by providing effective technical consultation. It gives me the opportunity to bring together my passion of teaching as well as my experience in programming.
