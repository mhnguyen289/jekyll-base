I've used Netlify to deploy several Jekyll-based websites now and am extremely impressed by the feature set and robustness of the service. It's become indespensible to me as a cloud solution for building heavily-customized Jekyll sites. Heck, I can fire up an app on my iPad, make a change to a Markdown file, commit it to the Git repo and push, and a few seconds later the site is rebuilt and updated on CDNs everywhere.

One thing that I think it's important to make clear and highlight is how Netlify "static sites" aren't static at all, they just "pre-build" the pages so that the web can be easier to develop, more secure and faster for the end user. 

The main limitation of this approach was not being able to let non tech-savvy editors used to work with ie. WordPress to autonomously update their sites, but with new tools like ie. https://www.datocms.com that is no longer the case.

I really hope this new "static wave" will be the future for the majority of small/medium websites, there are only advantages for everyone involved (developers and end-users).
