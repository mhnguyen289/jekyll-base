I really enjoyed being able to use Netlify's service in order to get a more hands on approach to what new users go through and if any issues they may come across. 

If I were interviewing a potential support engineer, I would have the interviewee submit a video tutorial and allow them to explain how to set up a specific feature. This would show that the interviewee has understood the basic set up features as well as displaying their verbal and technical abilities.
