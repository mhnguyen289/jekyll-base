I've used Netlify to deploy several Jekyll-based websites now and am  impressed by the simple feature set and robustness of the service. It's become indespensible to me as a cloud solution for building heavily-customized Jekyll sites. I've even used my tablet to make changes to a Markdown file, while also being able to commit it to the Git repo, push, and see that its updated. 

I think the only gripe I had when first using Netlify's service was that the cost for hosting wasn't free. However, I learned that there's an option to have your site be open sourced which would allow the cost to be free!
