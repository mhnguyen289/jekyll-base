The reason why SSL is important is because it encrypts the data between the client's web browser and web server in order for sensitive information to be transferred securely without the fear of it being decoded. This is especially important for customers that use Netlify's service in case of hackers exposing their private keys, customer's login information, or even the threat of malware being installed if SSL is not present during online payments or transactions.

There are many type of intruders that are trying to exploit unprotected resources between your websites and users.

HTTPS doesn't just block misuse of your website, it's also a requirement for many features, such as taking pictures or recording audio.
