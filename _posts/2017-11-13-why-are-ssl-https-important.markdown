The reason why SSL is important is because it encrypts the data between the client's web browser and web server in order for sensitive information that is being sent can be transferred securely without the fear of it being decoded. This is especially important for customers that use Netlify's service in case of exposing their private keys, their customers user's login information, or even malware may be injected if SSL is not present during online payments/transactions.
